## Current areas of interest
This are my main interest as of now, and the topics that provide categories for this blog.

### 1. Vires In Numeris
The topic that I'm really now into and that provides a "name" for my blog. 
I found this sentence on my ledger nano S (you kinda know what I'm talking about, right?)

I started to gain interest in Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology when
I decided to put time into understanding how our current
monetary system works, and realized that it was complete crap.

### 2. Productivity + Personal Development 
Kind of broad topics yes, I'm more precisely interested in obtaining a good productivity system (right now very focused
on bullet journaling)

Also trying to build a good Knowledge Managment System (Trying out a bunch of different approaches and apps)

### 3. Programming
Also a very broad and scarse way of describing an area of interest. To be clear, I just installed Majaro linux
on my main machine, so yes you could say I'm into Linux. 

And last but not least, Reverse Engeneering + Binary Explotaition.
I'm enjoying a lot the website crackmes.one and reversing C binaries with radare2 (A terminal
based RSE tool, very difficult to master i must say)
