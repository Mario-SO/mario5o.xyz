## Current areas of interest
This are my main interest as of now, and the topics that provide categories for this blog.

### 1. Vires In Numeris 💰
The topic that I'm really now into and that provides a "name" for my blog. 
I found this sentence on my ledger nano S (you kinda know what I'm talking about, right?)

I started to gain interest in Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology when
I decided to put time into understanding how our current
monetary system works, and realized that it was complete crap.

### 2. Productivity + Personal Development 🦾
Kind of broad topics yes, I'm more precisely interested in obtaining a good productivity system (right now very focused
on GTD)

Also trying to build a good Knowledge Managment System (Trying out Obsidian, Roam Research is to elitist 😐)

### 3. Programming 👨‍💻
Also a very broad and scarse way of describing an area of interest. To be clear, I just installed Manjaro linux
on my main machine (Arch linux for pussys), so yes you could say I'm into Linux.

**UPDATE: No more my main machine but still into it :)**. 

Last but not least, I'm starting to gain a lot of interest on competitive programming and cibersecurity, so you can also expect 
some posts about some CP problems and also write-ups about HTB machines. I actually wrote a post on [Medium](https://codeburst.io/greedy-algorithms-101-957842232cf2) about Greedy algs some time ago.
